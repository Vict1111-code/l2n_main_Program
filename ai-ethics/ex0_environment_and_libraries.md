## My AI Learning Commitment

### I will use AI to:
- Amplify my understanding
- Challenge my assumptions
- Explore beyond my current knowledge
- Work faster after I understand deeply

### I will NOT use AI to:
- Avoid the struggle of learning
- Get answers I haven't earned
- Skip building fundamentals
- Replace my own thinking

## Reflection

This workspace is for learning, not just finishing tasks.  
AI will act as a reviewer after effort, not a shortcut before effort.
If I cannot explain a solution, I have not learned it.
