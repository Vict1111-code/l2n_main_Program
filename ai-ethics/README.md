# Responsible AI Quest – Ethics, Bias & Learning Amplification

---

## Overview

Before working with prompts and large language models (LLMs), it is essential to understand the ethical foundations of artificial intelligence.

This quest introduces the core principles of responsible AI use:

- **Fairness**
- **Transparency**
- **Accountability**

You will learn how to:

- Identify bias in datasets and model outputs  
- Design safe and transparent prompts  
- Handle incorrect or harmful outputs responsibly  
- Think critically about the broader societal impact of AI  

### Critical Addition: Becoming Irreplaceable

AI can already generate code, debug syntax, and implement algorithms quickly. If your only skill is writing code that AI can produce, you are replaceable.

Your goal is to become **irreplaceable** by developing:

- Judgment  
- Systems thinking  
- Deep conceptual understanding  
- Independent learning ability  

This Piscine trains you to think independently and use AI to sharpen your thinking — not replace it.

---

## Research Expectations

You are encouraged to explore:

- Official documentation (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face)
- Academic research papers
- Global AI principles (UNESCO, OECD)
- Responsible AI standards from trusted organizations

Avoid relying on unverified summaries or unchecked online content. Use primary, credible sources.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this quest, you will be able to:

- Understand core AI ethics principles  
- Identify common types of bias  
- Design ethical and transparent prompts  
- Mitigate harmful or misleading outputs  
- Use AI to amplify learning rather than avoid it  
- Develop skills that make you irreplaceable as a coder

# Exercise 00 – Learning to Use AI Ethically as a Coder

## Objective

Understand the difference between:

- Using AI to get answers  
- Using AI to build understanding  

---

## Part A – The Critical Distinction

Reflect honestly:

- How have you used AI for coding so far?
- Do you ask for solutions before trying yourself?
- Can you explain your submitted code without AI?
- What happens if AI is unavailable during an exam?

### Learner Types

**Learner A – Answer Generator**
- Asks for full solutions
- Copies code
- Cannot explain logic

**Learner B – Learning Amplifier**
- Attempts independently first
- Asks why something works
- Tests and explains understanding
- Uses AI to deepen thinking

**Deliverable:**  
Write a paragraph explaining where you are now and where you want to be.

---

## Part B – Wrong Way vs Right Way

### Challenge: Implement a Palindrome Function

### Track A (Observe, Do NOT Follow)
- Ask AI immediately
- Copy solution
- Submit and move on

### Track B (Required)

#### Step 1 – Independent Attempt
- Write pseudocode
- Implement in Python
- Test with:
  - `racecar`
  - `hello`
  - `A man a plan a canal Panama`
- Debug independently
- Add comments explaining logic

#### Step 2 – Strategic AI Use
Ask AI:
- What is the time complexity?
- What edge cases am I missing?
- What are alternative approaches?
- Performance on long strings?

#### Step 3 – Reflection
- What did you learn by struggling?
- How is your understanding different?
- Can you now implement similar functions without AI?

---

## Part C – Variations (No AI First)

Modify your function to:

- Ignore spaces and punctuation
- Be case-insensitive
- Return failure position if not a palindrome

Then use AI to review and optimize.

---

## Part D – The Fairness Contract

Create `ex00_ai_ethics_coder.md` including:

### I will use AI when:
- After attempting a problem for 20+ minutes
- To understand why something works
- To explore alternatives

### I will NOT use AI when:
- I haven't tried first
- During exams
- Building core fundamentals

### I know I'm using AI fairly when:
- I can explain my code independently
- I can solve similar problems without AI
- My confidence increases

Sign and date the contract.

---

## Part E – Real-World Scenarios

Reflect on:

- Explaining caching systems in interviews  
- Debugging production at 2 AM  
- Learning new tech with limited documentation  

Write a paragraph explaining how fair AI use prepares you.

---

## Part F – Building Irreplaceable Skills

Rate yourself (1–5):

- Problem decomposition  
- Systems thinking  
- Critical evaluation  
- Debugging mindset  
- Conceptual understanding  

Write a 3-step action plan to improve your weakest area — without outsourcing thinking to AI.

---

## Deliverable

Submit `ex00_ai_ethics_coder.md` containing:

- Self-assessment  
- Palindrome solution + reflection  
- Personal fairness contract  
- Scenario analysis  
- Skills assessment + action plan  

---

# Exercise 0 – Environment and Libraries

## Objective
Prepare your workspace.

### Optional:
```bash
python --version

- Open a notebook or markdown file for reflections.
- Add links to ethical AI resources you plan to reference.
- Write your personal AI ethics commitment.

---

# Exercise 1 – Understanding AI Bias

## Objective

Identify and explain bias in AI systems.

### Part A – Independent Work

- Find or simulate a bias example.
- Explain why the bias exists.
- Propose one mitigation strategy.

### Part B – Strategic AI Use

Ask AI to critique:

- Your explanation  
- Your mitigation

- Potential harm  
- Hidden assumptions  

Rewrite each prompt to be safer and clearer.  
Explain your improvements.

Handle unsafe or misleading AI outputs responsibly.

### Part A – Safety Analysis

Test a risky prompt and identify:

- Factual errors  
- Potential harm
