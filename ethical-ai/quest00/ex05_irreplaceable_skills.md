| Problem Decomposition    | Breaking down problems logically          | 3           | Before coding, write step‑by‑step algorithm in plain English and convert it into functions  |
| Systems Thinking         | Understanding how components interact     | 2           | Draw diagrams of program flow (input → processing → output → storage) before implementation |
| Critical Evaluation      | Knowing when code is wrong or inefficient | 2           | After solving, rewrite solution a second time aiming for fewer conditions and clearer logic |
| Debugging Mindset        | Investigating unexpected behavior         | 3           | Use print/log tracing to follow execution instead of immediately rewriting code             |
| Conceptual Understanding | Knowing WHY, not just HOW                 | 3           | Read documentation and explain concepts aloud without looking at code                       |

## Lowest‑Rated Skill

**Chosen Skill:** Systems Thinking

### 3 Actions I Will Take This Week (without AI)

1. For every exercise, draw a diagram showing data flow between functions before coding.
2. Build a small CLI tool that reads a file, processes it, and outputs a result — documenting each component’s responsibility.
3. Manually trace program execution using logs and write a written explanation of how data moves through the system.
