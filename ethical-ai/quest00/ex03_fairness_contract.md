# Fairness Contract

## Purpose

As a beginner in tech, I am committed to building real competence, not shortcuts. This contract defines how I will use AI as a learning accelerator — not a replacement for thinking. My goal is long-term mastery, integrity, and confidence in my technical abilities.

---

## I will use AI when:

* I have genuinely attempted the problem on my own and reached a clear limitation.
* I need conceptual clarification ("why" something works, not just "what" works).
* I want to compare multiple approaches after building my own solution first.
* I need help debugging after systematically analyzing my code.
* I am reviewing my solution to improve structure, readability, or efficiency.

---

## I will NOT use AI when:

* I have not made a serious independent attempt.
* I am completing an exam, graded assessment, or evaluation.
* I am practicing foundational concepts that require repetition and mental effort.
* I am tempted to copy instead of understand.
* I cannot explain the logic behind the solution.

---

## I know I'm using AI fairly when:

* I can explain my code line-by-line without assistance.
* I can solve a similar problem independently within a reasonable time.
* I understand the trade-offs between different approaches.
* I feel stronger in my problem-solving ability, not dependent.
* My confidence comes from comprehension, not completion.

## My Commitment

> I commit to using AI as a mentor, not a crutch.
> I will prioritize deep learning over speed.
> I will measure my growth by what I can build and explain independently.
