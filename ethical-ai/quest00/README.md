## What I learned about AI and self-reliance

During this quest I noticed that I used to see AI mainly as a fast answer provider.
When I started solving problems before asking AI, I struggled more at first, especially when handling string indexes, debugging logic, thinking about edge cases.
However, after verifying my own solution with AI, I understood why my approach worked or failed.

This made me realize that learning happens during the attempt, not when reading the answer.
AI became more useful after I had something to compare against.

## My main insight about using AI ethically as a coder

The biggest lesson for me is that AI should confirm understanding, not replace thinking.
If I ask AI too early, I only copy patterns.
If I ask after trying, I actually learn reasoning.

So ethical use for me means:

- first struggle with the problem
- then use AI to check gaps in my understanding
- finally rewrite the idea in my own words or logic

The difference is confidence — I can now explain my code without depending on the tool.

## How I will apply this in future quests

In future quests I will delay using AI until after my first working attempt, even if it is messy or incomplete.
I will treat AI as a reviewer instead of a generator.
When I get stuck, I will first reread the problem, trace my logic manually, and only then ask targeted questions instead of requesting full solutions.

My goal is to build the habit of understanding systems deeply so that AI improves my thinking rather than replacing it.
